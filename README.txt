HOW TO GET STARTED

Many versions of Blender are incompatible with Unity! Using a wrong Blender version may cause materials of the .blend files 
not be imported correctly in Unity.

Use the Windows installer for Blender version 2.80 which is available here:
https://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.80/blender-2.80-windows64.msi

(Also Blender version 2.93 has been tested to work. Version 3.0 and newer ones don't seem to work.)

If the models appear to be empty and the actual mesh is missing in many MeshFilter components, re-install Unity using Unity Hub 
and open Unity Hub as Windows Admininistrator (right click, select "Run as administrator").
